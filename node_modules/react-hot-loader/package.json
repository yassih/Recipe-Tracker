If you want to get most of React Hot Loader, consider switching to [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) (Note: it's currently in beta!). If you want to understand the reasoning, it's good to start in [React Router v4 FAQ](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v4/README.md#v4-faq)\n\n## The Talk\n\nReact Hot Loader was demoed together with **[Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)** at React Europe.\nWatch **[Dan Abramov's talk on Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs).**\n\n## React Native\n\nReact Native **[supports hot reloading natively](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html)** as of version 0.22.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf something doesn't work, in 99% cases it's a configuration issue. A missing option, a wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup, such as **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**, bit by bit. We're also gathering **[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)** so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!\n\n## Documentation\n\nCheck out the [docs directory](docs).\n\nYou can also check out a great [webpack guide to React hot module replacement](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/).\n\n## Got Questions?\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/gaearon/react-hot-loader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\nWatch the repo to stay tuned!\n\n## Patrons\n\nThe work on React Hot Loader, [React Transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), and related projects was [funded by the community](https://www.patreon.com/reactdx).\nMeet some of the outstanding companies that made it possible:\n\n* [Webflow](https://github.com/webflow)\n* [Ximedes](https://www.ximedes.com/)\n\n[See the full list of React Hot Loader patrons.](PATRONS.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT (https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",
